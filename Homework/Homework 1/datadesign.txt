1.) I used a LineStorage object to store the lines read from the input file. This structure manages the original lines read and
offers methods to retrieve the read lines and words. Its contents are determined by the Input (interface) readLines method.

2.) I used a Shifter object to store circular shifted lines. The shifter aggregates the LineStorage class. It uses LineStorage's
methods to build the shifted lines. Since LineStorage contains the original lines, the indexes are maintained and hence are appended
to the end of the shifted lines respectively.

3.) I used a Sorter (Interface) object. This object aggregates the Shifter object, and calls the shifter's method to retrieve
the shifted lines. It then sorts them by implementation (in the case of this assignment, alphabetically).
